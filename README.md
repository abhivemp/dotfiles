# .files

dotfiles are like powerups. Make you hell of a lot more productive. These are mine.

I've taken inspiration from a lot of developers on GitHub. Credits goes to:

Holman for showing me the topical setup

webpro for showing me bootstraps

I have a different setup. I have a Windows machine but I develop on Linux. I don't use a WSL though (yes, you can hate me for that. Or not). Rather, I use Cygwin (git bash) because most of my files stay in the Windows disk.

There weren't a lot of tutorials on configuring a dotfiles repo for Windows users that use git bash. Perhaps I can create something later on.
